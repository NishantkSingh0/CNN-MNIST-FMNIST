# Subclassing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for MNIST & Fashion MNIST classification.

# Overview
This repository contains a TensorFlow/Keras implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to classify MNIST & Fashion-MNIST dataset. 

# Model Architecture
The CNN model is defined using the subclassing method in TensorFlow/Keras. Here's a brief overview of the architecture:
